            <h3>Product Description</h3><br>
            <p>The internationally bestselling guide to leading a less anxious life and becoming more productive in the process, from Chris Bailey, the bestselling author of Hyperfocus.</p><br>
            <p>How to Calm Your Mind offers a toolkit of accessible, science-backed strategies that reveal how the path to a less anxious life, and even greater productivity, runs directly through calm.</p><br>
            <p>When productivity expert Chris Bailey discovered that he had become stressed and burnt out because he was pushing himself too hard, he realized that he had no right to be giving advice on productivity without learning when and how to rein things in and take a break. Productivity advice works – and we need it now more than ever – but it’s just as important that we also develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don’t just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time. We build a deeper, more expansive reservoir of energy to draw from throughout the day, and have greater mental resources at our disposal not only to do good work, but also to live a good life.</p><br>
            <p>The pursuit of calm ultimately leads us to become more engaged, focused and deliberate – while making us more productive and satisfied with our lives overall. In an anxious world, achieving calm is the best life hack around.</p><br>
            <p>Chris Bailey ran a year-long productivity project where he conducted intensive research, as well as dozens of productivity experiments on himself, to discover how to become as productive as possible. To date, he has written hundreds of articles on the subject and has garnered coverage in media as diverse as The New York Times, Huffington Post, New York magazine, Harvard Business Review, TED, Fast Company and Lifehacker. The author of Hyperfocus and The Productivity Project, Chris lives in Kingston, Ontario, in Canada.</p>
